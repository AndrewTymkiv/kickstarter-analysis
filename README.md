#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project analyzes the history of various Kickstarter campaigns and provides insight to why some were successful and some failed.
Some filters used to analyze and compare the data include dates and lengths of the campaigns, campaign goals, amount pledged, and average donation.
The findings provide evidence that campaigns launched in the spring and summer months are the most successful. Furthermore, the data suggests that campaigns with smaller goals tend to be more successful than other campaigns that have larger goals.
In order to have a successful campaign, I would suggest a launch date in or around the month of May, and a fundin goal of approximately $5,000.
